# Problems
1. Write a program to check if inputted letter is small or capital <br>
2. Write a program to calculate GPA and find grade<br>
3. Input 2 decimal numbers and check if they are both same or different up to two decimal places. E.g 120.546 & 120.241<br>
4. Write a program to check balance and withdraw money from ATM booth using if else or switch case<br>
5. Write a program to sum of numbers which only divisible by 5 from 1 to 100<br>
6. Write  a program to find the factorial of a given number<br>
7. Write a program to print prime numbers from 2 to n<br>
8. Write a program to generate 2 random numbers which will not be shown to the user. Take a user input and match it with any of the random numbers. If correct give it 1 point and if incorrect, do not give it any point. Finally, repeat this for 10 times and count the point user achieved.<br>
9. Write a program to sum of user input until users input ‘q’ from keyboard<br>
10. Write a program to enter the numbers till the user wants and at the end, the program should display the largest and smallest numbers user entered.<br>

# Solved Techniques
used if-else/switch-case and for/while/do-while to solve these problems.
